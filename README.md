# movies_website-for-wolkus

This is a movies mini project project where one can fetch the movie by searching it in search bar given in the application ,

we also added a feature called wishlist where one can add movies to their wishlist and also remove them when they want,one can view the list of the movies added to wishlist and remove them if needed 

## steps to run the project

1)down load all the files from here

2)create a database as shown with required fields used in our signup and login page ,connect ur database with our project then simply signup and login to our homepage 

3)i had uploaded both modules differently to remove your ambigness (login module for login and signup) and wishlist module(where the actual project is done using umdb api

4) if you directly want to check the movies project ,download only wishlist module and run the index.html file

## Tools and Technologies Used

1)HTML

2)CSS

3)JAVASCRIPT

4)OMDB API

## How it works 

i am using ombd api as backend ,from there we will fetch or retrieve data in form of json format in my index.js file in wishlist module then from that api link i split the data in key value pairs and display them if needed ,then added a search bar also
